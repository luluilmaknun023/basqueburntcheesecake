<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Pour the matcha batter into the cake pan, followed by the original cheesecake batter. Knock on countertop to prevent air bubbles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Bake in the preheated oven at 210&deg;C for approximately 25 to 30min. When you remove the cheesecake from the oven, it should still be jiggly and wobbly. This is normal, and you don&apos;t need to bake it for longer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. With the cheesecake still in the pan, let it chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours, or till it is completely chilled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. Gently remove the cake from the pan and peel off the baking paper. Slice and serve!</p>
