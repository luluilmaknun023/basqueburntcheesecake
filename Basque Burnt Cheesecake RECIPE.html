<p>To prepare a traditional Basque Burnt Cheesecake you will need the following ingredients:</p>

<p>- 1 kg of cream cheese<br />
- 400 g of sugar<br />
- 1/2 l of cream<br />
- 7 eggs<br />
- 1 tablespoon of flour</p>

<p>How to Make Basque Burnt Cheesecake:</p>

<p>1. First combine the eggs with fresh cheese, one at a time, mixing with an electric mixer. In a separate container, combine the flour with the sugar, then add them to the egg and cheese mixture, beating continuously with an electric mixer.</p>

<p>2. At this point grease a tin and line it with damp and crushed baking paper. Let the parchment paper should protrude from the pan by at least 5 fingers: this will make it easier to un-mould your cake once cooked.</p>

<p>3. Then pour the dough into the pan and bake at 220 degrees (static oven) for about 45 minutes. Don't be scared if the surface of your cake becomes very black during cooking: this is the extra touch that will make your cake an authentic burnt Basque cheesecake.</p>

<p>4. When you take the cake out of the oven, you will notice that it will have burnt edges while the inside will move like a pudding - that's just the right texture. In fact, you must let the cake cool for at least 2 hours at room temperature, then you can remove it from the pan with the help of excess parchment paper.</p>

<p>5. Once cooled, keep your burnt Basque cheesecake in the refrigerator, making sure to bring it back to room temperature about 15 minutes before serving.</p>
