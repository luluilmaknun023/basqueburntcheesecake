<p>Basque Cheesecake or Basque Burnt Cheesecake was created in 1990 by a chef named Santiago Rivera of a restaurant called La Vi&ntilde;a in San Sebastian, Spain. But where does all this interest and overseas affection for the Basque cheesecake come from? It seems that 'love at first sight' happened about ten years ago, when some famous chefs 'discovered' the dessert in San Sebastian and started to replicate it in their kitchens.</p>

<p>But let's take another step back: where and when was the Basque cheesecake born? Tradition has it that La Vi&ntilde;a, a traditional bar-restaurant in the old part of San Sebasti&aacute;n, served the Basque cheesecake for the first time some thirty years ago. At the time, probably no one would have bet on its future success: the cake, although delicious on the palate, has in fact the main characteristic of having a burnt and therefore blackened surface. Hence the name 'burnt' in English. So forget the American cheesecake cousin, whose external beauty happens to prevail over the actual balance of taste. The Basque cheesecake is and must be charred, with rough and irregular edges and a soft and melting heart. The secret is in fact all there, in that scorched surface that adds that unique and unmistakable aroma to its complexity, which recalls notes of salted caramel or browned butter.</p>

<p>Let's now take a leap forward, to the 2000s, precisely to 2013 when chefs Grant Achatz, Mike Bagale and David Beran of Chicago's Alinea and Next restaurants flew to Spain in search of inspiration for their new menus. The definitive love at first sight for burnt Basque cheesecake took place at Mugaritz, where chef Andoni Luis Aduriz was careful not to give his recipe to colleagues from overseas but limited himself to providing them with some 'suggestions'.</p>

<p>This was enough to unleash the challenge of the definitive burned cheesecake among the three chefs, once they returned home. And consequently, more generally, the Basque cheesecake-mania that has gradually delineated throughout the United States and also in other parts of the world such as Turkey and Japan.</p>

<p>Today there are many pastry shops as well as high-level restaurants that offer their version of the burnt Basque cheesecake. A corner of San Sebastian which, starting almost as a bet, ended up touring the four corners of the planet and conquering the most diverse palates.</p>

<p>Creamy on the inside and caramelized on the outside, this Basque Burnt Cheesecake is remarkably easy and quick to make. Baked at a high temperature, the cheesecake&rsquo;s iconic rich dark top is a show-stopper.</p>

<p>Besides its obvious &ldquo;burnt&rdquo; look, here are some of the characteristics of this cheesecake:</p>

<p>Texture: Creamy in the middle, firmer cheesecake texture on the exterior. Unlike American cheesecake, it does not have a crust.<br />
Flavor: Simply put, it tastes like a caramelized cheesecake in one bite. It has a good balance of bitterness from the burnt exterior and sweetness from the creamy custardy interior.<br />
Difficulty: This is absolutely the easiest cheesecake I&rsquo;ve ever made. I told Mr. JOC that a man who had never baked in his life can impress loved ones with this cheesecake!<br />
Baking: The cheesecake is finished baking in half the time compared to regular cheesecake! Bake at a higher temperature to achieve that rich, dark caramelized exterior surface, yet the center of the cheesecake is still jiggly.<br />
Time: Mix ingredients, bake for 30-35 minutes, and chill. Fast and easy!</p>
