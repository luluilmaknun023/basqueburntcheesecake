<p>HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?</p>

<p>So for this recipe, you can either put it together as one cake or you can make mini cheesecakes in a muffin tin. For a full cake, click here (following instructions and just add blueberries at the end). If you want, you can also make these in large ramekins. This recipe will make around 2 dozen cheesecakes in your muffin tin, 1 large cake in a springform pan (9 inch), or 4-5 large ramekins filled with the batter.</p>

<p>1. Set your oven to 400&deg;F. Take your room temperature cream cheese and place in the bowl of your mixmaster or a bowl that you can use with a hand-mixer. Beat the cream cheese on medium for a few minutes, it will become very light and fluffy. Once you have done this, add your sugar. Continue to beat for 4-5 minutes on a medium high heat.<br />
2. Scrape down the side of your bowl to make sure everything has been incorporated on the sides of the bowl. Add your eggs now (one at a time) until each is fully mixed in. Once the eggs are all in, add the vanilla. Now is the time to add your cream. Mix for one minute. You are going to mix in the flour by hand. Add the flour to the bowl and use a spatula to blend it all together.<br />
3. Spray your pan, ramekins, or muffin tin with a cooking spray (I use Pam), and take 2 pieces of parchment paper. You want the entirety of the bottom and sides to be covered. If it is crunchy in places, that is okay! It will give more character to your cake. Pour your batter into the pan, toss the blueberries in there, and place in the oven for 1 hour.<br />
4. Remove at the 1 hour mark; your cake should be jiggly in the middle and have a nice browned color on top. If it has cracks, all the better! Allow the cake to cool in the pan on the counter for 1 hour. After your one hour, transfer the cake to the fridge for a second hour to chill. After sitting in the fridge for an hour, you are free to slice up your cake, serve, and dive in!<br />
5. If you are making in a muffin tin, bake for 30 minutes. Make sure they look good and brown and cracked on top. If not, place them back in the oven for 5 minutes at a time until done.</p>
